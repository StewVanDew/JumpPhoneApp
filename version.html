    V0.0.1 - this was the initial release. Primarily built with list.js a small framework that allows to query
    an unordered list. This was to static and didn't allow for some of the planned features. This needed
    to change.
  </p>
  <p>
    V0.0.2 - Removed list.js and moved to something that can scale. Behold Angular.js, oh the fun.
    I want to plan some features that needed flexability of a front end framework like angular.
  </p>
  <p>
    V0.0.3 - Added the framework foundation. This allows for rapid development and prototyping to bring features
    quicker. Redesigned the website into more of a 'website', instead of a simple tool. Looking to
    redesign the material design card that the phone prices are viewed on. Maybe something like a list view would be better.
    I'm also looking to add more mobile support.
  </p>
  <p>
    V0.0.4 - With the new release of Foundations I found it hard to manipulate
    and tweak code quickly. I want this project to be a simple tool. Things seem to be running nicely with Angular.js.
    A price rotator was added just below the logo which is a nice little touch. I went for a very nice simplistic
    clean look with this release. I think I'm going to stick to this design and keep adding on it.
    If I find the time I'm going to develop a Node.js API that will allow for web scraping. No more Manual editing. HOORAY
    Mobile support is there now but I need to tweak the way the phone prices are showing. It's not the nicest thing to look at.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Current Version 0.0.5</strong> - Added a simple date that I updated the price on so people know the phone
    prices are current and up to date.
